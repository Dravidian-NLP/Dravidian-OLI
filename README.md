This is the code for the paper ```Offensive Language Identification in Low-resourced Code-mixed Dravidian languages using Pseudo-labeling```

This is a collaborative work by [Adeep Hande](https://github.com/adeepH), [Karthik Puranik](https://github.com/karthikpuranik11), [Konthala Yasaswini](https://github.com/yasaswinik12), Ruba Priyadharshini, Sajeetha Thavareesan, Anbukkarasi Sampath, 
Kogilavani Shanmugavadivel, Durairaj Thenmozhi, and [Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi](https://github.com/bharathichezhiyan)

This approach could be used for any multilingual datasets. The weights of the fine-tuned models are available on my Huggingface account [AdWeeb](https://huggingface.co/AdWeeb).

We have provided the [notebooks](https://github.com/adeepH/Dravidian-OLI/tree/main/Notebooks) for reference.
